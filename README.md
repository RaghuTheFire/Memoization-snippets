Memoization is a systematic technique that involves storing already calculated results to avoid unnecessary calculations when solving sub-problems. The term "memoization" is derived from the word "memo", which denotes the act of remembering. This approach ensures that if a particular sub-problem has been solved before, its solution is stored for future reference rather than having to be recomputed.
Implementation: A Step-by-Step Guide

Let's learn about the steps involved in implementing memorization:

1. Identify recurring subproblems:
Understand the problem at hand and identify sub-problems to be solved again and again.

2. Create a memoization table or cache:
Establish a data structure, often a table or a dictionary, to store solutions to sub-problems. It acts as a cache for quick access.

3. Check the memoization table before iteration:
Before solving a sub-problem, check the memoization table. If the solution already exists, retrieve it; Otherwise, proceed with the calculations.

4. Store results in-memory table:
After solving a sub-problem, store the result in a memoization table for future use.
Benefits of Memorization

The benefits of memorization run deep:

Reduction in Time Complexity:
By avoiding unnecessary calculations, memorization significantly reduces the algorithm's time complexity. Subproblems that have already been solved do not need to be recalculated.

Efficient handling of large inputs:
Memoization enables efficient handling of large inputs, making it particularly valuable in scenarios where exhaustive computation is impractical.# memoization-snippets
Memoization is a specific form of caching that is used in dynamic programming. The purpose of caching is to improve the performance of our programs and keep data accessible that can be used later. It basically stores the previously calculated result of the subproblem and uses the stored result for the same subproblem. This removes the extra effort to calculate again and again for the same problem. And we already know that if the same problem occurs again and again, then that problem is recursive in nature.
